# String Library Project

## Project Description

The String Library Project is a C++ library aimed at illustrating and implementing some Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The project includes the use of header files to organize and make the code more structured and reusable in the future.

## Features

- Implementation of object-oriented concepts to handle and manipulate strings.
- Use of header files to partition the code for better organization and reusability.
- Basic string operations such as Replace Word, Reverse WordsIn String, Join String, IsVowel, Count Vowels, Count Specific Letter, and more.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:
- To gain practical experience with OOP principles.
- To familiarize oneself with organizing projects using header files.
- To implement fundamental string operations using object-oriented techniques.

## How to Use

To use this String Library, you can:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the necessary header files in your C++ project.
3. Utilize the provided string manipulation functions in your code.
